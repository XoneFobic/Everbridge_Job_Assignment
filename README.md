## Front-end assessment
We like to see what you can do and how you work. That’s why we are giving you the following assessment. There are a few requirements. Please don’t spend more than 2 hours on the assessment excluding setting up the project.  
Use GitHub for this assessment so that we can evaluate your code.  
  
## What are we making?
The goal is to create a grocery shopping list. As a user, I want to be able to add, edit, delete and check off items on my grocery shopping list. The grocery shopping list should persist with data when the user closes the application and comes back.  
  
_So, basically the tutorial ToDo-List application?_
